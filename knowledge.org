* Linux Pipe =|= 

A pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing. The Unix/Linux systems allow the stdout of a command to be connected to the stdin of another command. You can make it do so by using the pipe character =|=.
